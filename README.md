# TASK

Complete a small version of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_Ladders;

- Player Vs Bot 
- Where possible, show UI decoupling from game core logic
- Use events (as delegates or Action)


The main classes are mostly implemented but not binded together.

Evaluation is based:

 1. Working gameplay
 2. Applying SOLID principles 
 3. Completing/implementing automated tests
 4. Use of Git and GitHub appropriately

The UI and game view design is implemented, design to be 16:9 screen-ratio.

To save time, you may upgrade the project to a Unity version you may have installed.

Clone or download and please send it privately to Daniel at Strolll. co
